# Introduction

The WebTransport Protocol Framework enables clients constrained by the Web
security model to communicate with a remote server using a secure multiplexed
transport.  It consists of a set of individual protocols that are safe to expose
to untrusted applications, combined with a model that allows them to be used
interchangeably.

This document defines the overall requirements on the protocols used in
WebTransport, as well as the common features of the protocols, support for some
of which may be optional.

## Background

Historically, web applications that needed a bidirectional data stream between a
client and a server could rely on WebSockets {{?RFC6455}}, a message-based
protocol compatible with the Web security model.  However, since the
abstraction it provides is a single ordered stream of messages, it suffers from
head-of-line blocking (HOLB), meaning that all messages must be sent and
received in order even if they are independent and some of them are no longer
needed.  This makes it a poor fit for latency-sensitive applications which rely
on partial reliability and stream independence for performance.

One existing option available to Web developers are WebRTC data channels
{{?I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel}}, which provide a WebSocket-like API for a
peer-to-peer SCTP channel protected by DTLS.  In theory, it is possible to use
it for the use cases addressed by this specification. However, in practice, its
use in non-browser-to-browser settings has been quite low due to its dependency
on ICE (which fits poorly with the Web model) and userspace SCTP (which has very
few implementations available).

An alternative design would be to layer WebSockets over HTTP/3
{{?I-D.ietf-quic-http}} in a manner similar to how they are currently layered
over HTTP/2 {{?RFC8441}}.  That would avoid head-of-line blocking and provide
an ability to cancel a stream by closing the corresponding WebSocket object.
However, this approach has a number of drawbacks, which all stem primarily from
the fact that semantically each WebSocket is a completely independent entity:

* Each new stream would require a WebSocket handshake to agree on application
  protocol used, meaning that it would take at least one RTT to establish each
  new stream before the client can write to it.
* Only clients can initiate streams.  Server-initiated streams and other
  alternative modes of communication (such as the QUIC DATAGRAM frame
  {{?I-D.pauly-quic-datagram}}) are not available.
* While the streams would normally be pooled by the user agent, this is not
  guaranteed, and the general process of mapping a WebSocket to a server is
  opaque to the client.  This introduces unpredictable performance properties
  into the system, and prevents optimizations which rely on the streams being on
  the same connection (for instance, it might be possible for the client to
  request different retransmission priorities for different streams, but that
  would be much more complex unless they are all on the same connection).

The WebTransport protocol framework avoids all of those issues by letting
applications create a single transport object that can contain multiple streams
multiplexed together in a single context (similar to SCTP, HTTP/2, QUIC and
others), and can be also used to send unreliable datagrams (similar to UDP).

## Conventions and Definitions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

WebTransport is a framework that aims to abstract away the underlying transport
protocol while still exposing a few key transport-layer aspects to application
developers.  It is structured around the following concepts:

Transport session:

: A transport session is a single communication context established between a
  client and a server.  It may correspond to a specific transport-layer
  connection, or it may be a logical entity within an existing multiplexed
  transport-layer connection.  Transport sessions are logically independent
  from one another even if some sessions can share an underlying
  transport-layer connection.

Transport protocol:

:  A transport protocol (WebTransport protocol in contexts where this might be
   ambiguous) is an instantiation of WebTransport over a given transport-layer
   protocol.

Datagram:

: A datagram is a unit of transmission that is treated atomically.

Stream:

: A stream is a sequence of bytes that is reliably delivered to the receiving
  application in the same order as it was transmitted by the sender.  Streams
  can be of arbitrary length, and therefore cannot always be buffered entirely
  in memory. It is expected for transport protocols and APIs to provide partial
  stream data to the application before the stream has been entirely received.

Message:

: A message is a stream that is sufficiently small that it can be fully buffered
  before being passed to the application.  WebTransport does not define messages
  as a primitive, since from the transport perspective they can be simulated
  by fully buffering a stream before passing it to the application.  However,
  this distinction is important to highlight since some of the similar protocols
  and APIs (notably WebSocket {{?RFC6455}}) use messages as a core abstraction.

Transport property:

: A transport property is a specific behavior that may or may not be exhibited
  by a transport.  Some of those are inherent for all instances of a given
  transport protocol (TCP-based transport cannot support unreliable delivery),
  while others can vary even within the same protocol (QUIC connections may or
  may not support connection migration).

Server:

: A WebTransport server is an application that accepts incoming transport
  sessions.

Client:

: A WebTransport client is an application that initiates the transport
  session and may be running in a constrained security context, for instance,
  a JavaScript application running inside a browser.

User agent:

: A WebTransport user agent is a software system that has an unrestricted
  access to the host network stack and can create transports on behalf
  of the client.

# Common Transport Requirements  {#common-requirements}

Since clients are not necessarily trusted and have to be constrained by the
Web security model, WebTransport imposes certain requirements on any specific
transport protocol used.

Any transport protocol used MUST use TLS {{!RFC8446}} or a semantically
equivalent security protocol (for instance, DTLS {{?I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}).
The protocols SHOULD use TLS version 1.3 or later, unless they aim for
backwards compatibility with legacy systems.

Any transport protocol used MUST require the user agent to obtain and maintain
explicit consent from the server to send data.  For connection-oriented
protocols (such as TCP or QUIC), the connection establishment and keep-alive
mechanisms suffice.  STUN Consent Freshness {{?RFC7675}} is another example of
the mechanism satisfying this requirement.

Any transport protocol used MUST limit the rate at which the client sends data.
This SHOULD be accomplished via a feedback-based congestion control mechanism
(such as {{?RFC5681}} or {{?I-D.ietf-quic-recovery}}).

Any transport protocol used MUST support simultaneously establishing multiple
sessions between the same client and server.

Any transport protocol used MUST prevent the clients from establishing transport
sessions to network endpoints that are not WebTransport servers.

Any transport protocol used MUST provide a way for servers to filter clients
that can access it by checking the initiating origin {{!RFC6454}}.

Any transport protocol used MUST provide a way for a server endpoint location to
be described using a URI {{!RFC3986}}.  This enables integration with various
Web platform features that represent resources as URIs, such as Content Security
Policy [CSP].

# Session Establishment

WebTransport session begins with a handshake in which the client and the server
exchange a set of header fields.  This provides an opportunity for the parties
to exchange the metadata such as the origin of the client and the path
component of the URL.

A WebTransport session MUST NOT be considered established until it is secure
against replay attacks.  For instance, in protocols creating a new TLS 1.3
session {{!RFC8446}}, this would mean that the user agent MUST NOT treat the
session as established until it received a Finished message from the server.

In some cases, the transport protocol might allow transmitting data before the
session is established; an example is TLS 0-RTT data.  Since this data can be
replayed by attackers, it MUST NOT be used unless the client has explicitly
requested 0-RTT for specific streams or datagrams it knows to be safely
replayable.

## Headers

Any WebTransport protocol MUST provide a method for peers to exchange headers.
The client sends its header fields first; the server sends its headers in
response to the ones received from the client.

WebTransport headers are an unordered set of key-value pairs referred to as
header fields.  Header fields have names; a name of a header field is not
case-sensitive and it MUST be either a valid HTTP header name (Section 5.4.3 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}) or be one of `:scheme`, `:path`, `:authority`
and `:status`.  The values of the header fields MUST be a sequence of
non-control US ASCII characters as recommended in Section 5.4.4 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}.

The client MUST convey the URI of the request to the server by specifying the
`:scheme`, `:authority` and `:path` headers.  Those have the same semantics as
they do in HTTP/2 (Section 8.1.2.4 of {{!RFC7540}}).  Note that the `:method`
field is not included here; it is implied to be `CONNECT`.

The client MUST convey the origin of the resource initiating the connection
using the `Origin` header described in Section 7 of {{!RFC6454}}.

The server MUST reply with an HTTP status code (Section 14 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}) in the `:status` header.  Note that like in
HTTP, a status code indicating an error does not preclude subsequent data
exchange between the client and the server.

# Transport Features

The following transport features are defined in this document.  This list is not
meant to be comprehensive; future documents may define new features for both new
and already existing transports.

All transport protocols MUST provide datagrams, unidirectional and
bidirectional streams in order to make the transport protocols easily
interchangeable.

## Datagrams

A datagram is a sequence of bytes that is limited in size (generally to the path
MTU) and is not expected to be transmitted reliably.  The general goal for
WebTransport datagrams is to be similar in behavior to UDP while being subject
to common requirements expressed in {{common-requirements}}.

The WebTransport sender is not expected to retransmit datagrams, though it may
if it is using a TCP-based protocol or some other underlying protocol that
requires reliable delivery.  WebTransport datagrams are not expected to be flow
controlled, meaning that the receiver might drop datagrams if the application is
not consuming them fast enough.

The application MUST be provided with the maxiumum datagram size that it can
send.  The size SHOULD be derived from the result of performing path MTU
discovery.

## Streams

A unidirectional stream is a one-way reliable in-order stream of bytes where the
initiator is the only endpoint that can send data.  A bidirectional stream
allows both endpoints to send data and can be conceptually represented as a pair
of unidirectional streams.

The streams are in general expected to follow the semantics and the state
machine of QUIC streams ({{?I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}, Sections 2 and 3).
TODO: describe the stream state machine explicitly.

A WebTransport stream can be reset, indicating that the endpoint is not
interested in either sending or receiving any data related to the stream.  In
that case, the sender is expected to not retransmit any data that was already
sent on that stream.

Streams SHOULD be sufficiently lightweight that they can be used as messages.

Data sent on a stream is flow controlled by the transport protocol.  In addition
to flow controlling stream data, the creation of new streams is flow controlled
as well: an endpoint may only open a limited number of streams until the peer
explicitly allows creating more streams.

Every stream within a transport has a unique 64-bit number identifying it.  Both
unidirectional and bidirectional streams share the number space.  The client and
the server have to agree on the numbering, so it can be referenced in the
application payload.  WebTransport does not impose any other specific
restrictions on the structure of stream IDs, and they should be treated as
opaque 64-bit blobs.

## Protocol-Specific Features

In addition to features described above, there are some capabilities that may
be provided by an individual protocol but are not universally applicable to all
protocols.  Those are allowed, but any protocol is expected to be useful without
those features, and portable clients should not rely on them.

A notable class of protocol-specific features are features available only in
non-pooled transports.  Since those transports have a dedicated connection, a
user agent can provide clients with an extensive amount of transport-level data
that would be too noisy and difficult to interpret when the connection is shared
with unrelated traffic.  For instance, a user agent can provide the number of
packets lost, or the number of times stream data was delayed due to flow
control.  It can also expose variables related to congestion control, such as
the size of the congestion window or the current pacing rate.

## Bandwidth Prediction

Using congestion control state and transport metrics, the client can predict the
rate at which it can send data.  That is essential for many WebTransport use
cases; for instance, real time media applications adapt the video bitrate to be
a fraction of the throughput they expect to be available.  While not all
transport protocols can provide low-level transport details, all protocols
SHOULD provide the client with an estimate of the available bandwidth.

# Buffering and Prioritization

TODO: expand this outline into a full summary.

* Datagrams are intended for low-latency communications, so the buffers for them
  should be small, and prioritized over stream data.
* In general, the transport should not apply aggregation algorithms (e.g.,
  Nagle's algorithm {{?RFC0896}}) to datagrams.

# Transport Properties

In addition to common requirements, each transport can have multiple optional
properties associated with it.  Querying them allows the client to ascertain
the presence of features it can use without requiring knowledge of all
protocols.  This allows introducing new transports as drop-in replacements
for existing ones.

The following properties are defined in this specification:

* Stream independence.  This indicates that there is no head of line blocking
  between different streams.
* Partial reliability.  This indicates that if a stream is reset, none of the
  data sent on it will be retransmitted.  This also indicates that datagrams
  will not be retransmitted.
* Pooling support.  Indicates that multiple transports using this transport
  protocol may end up sharing the same transport layer connection, and thus
  share a congestion controller and other contexts.
* Connection mobility.  Indicates that the transport may continue existing even
  if the network path between the client and the server changes.

# Security Considerations

Providing untrusted clients with a reasonably low-level access to the network
comes with risks.  This document mitigates those risks by imposing a set of
common requirements described in {{common-requirements}}.

WebTransport mandates the use of TLS for all protocols implementing it.  This
has a dual purpose.  On one hand, it protects the transport from the network,
including both potential attackers and ossification by middleboxes.  On the
other hand, it protects the network elements from potential confusion attacks
such as the one discussed in Section 10.3 of {{?RFC6455}}.

One potential concern is that even when a transport cannot be created, the
connection error would reveal enough information to allow an attacker to scan
the network addresses that would normally be inaccessible.  Because of that, the
user agent that runs untrusted clients MUST NOT provide any detailed error
information until the server has confirmed that it is a WebTransport endpoint.
For example, the client must not be able to distinguish between a network
address that is unreachable and one that is reachable but is not a WebTransport
server.

WebTransport does not support any traditional means of HTTP-based
authentication.  It is not necessarily based on HTTP, and hence does not support
HTTP cookies or HTTP authentication.  Since it requires TLS, individual
transport protocols MAY expose TLS-based authentication capabilities such as
client certificates.
